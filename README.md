# UTLookup

The goal of UTLookup is to provide an easy, quick, and uniform way for the user to do the following things:

* Look up courses keeping in mind certain constraints. These constraints can be: 
 * Prerequisites
 * Corequisites
 * Times of the day
 * Days of the week
* Easy course search : search by course code or by keywords in the course name and description
* Set up course lists: you can have more than one possible schedule just in case things get messy
* Resolve course timetable conflicts (optional feature). See if two or more courses are in the same time slot, to help you find alternatives.

## Requirements

UTLookup requires an internet connection. Further requirements will be placed in this section. 
The internet connection is only required upon initial startup in order to retrieve the most recent course information.
Subsequent executions of the application will not require an internet connection unless the user wishes to check for course changes/updates. 
An option to automatically update upon start-up will be available, otherwise the user will have to manually synchronize.

### Version
We are currently in the design stage.
