# UTLookup

The goal of UTLookup is to provide an easy, quick, and uniform way for the user to do the following things:

* Look up courses keeping in mind certain constraints. These constraints can be: 
 * Prerequisites
 * Corequisites
 * Times of the day
 * Days of the week
* Easy course search : search by course code or by keywords in the course name and description
* Set up course lists: you can have more than one possible schedule just in case things get messy
* Resolve course timetable conflicts (optional feature). See if two or more courses are in the same time slot, to help you find alternatives.

## Requirements

UTLookup requires an internet connection. Further requirements will be placed in this section.

### Version
We are currently in the design stage.
